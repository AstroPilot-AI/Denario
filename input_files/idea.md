Project Idea:
	* Energy Transfer Dynamics and Beat Frequencies in Coupled Harmonic Oscillators
		- Investigate energy exchange and beat frequency phenomena in coupled harmonic oscillators.
		- Analyze weak, strong, and critical coupling regimes.
		- Provide insights into the dynamics of coupled systems.
		- Visualize phase space dynamics using dimensional reduction techniques like Poincar√© sections.
