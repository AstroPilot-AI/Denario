Project Idea:
	* Exploring Quantum Tunneling Effects in Optical Black Hole Analogues for Primordial Black Hole Detection
		- Investigates the use of nonlinear optical systems to mimic black hole event horizons.
		- Focuses on isolating quantum tunneling effects of photons as analogs to Hawking radiation.
		- Identifies potential signatures of primordial non-Gaussianity.
		- Key observable signatures include photon correlation functions, spectral shifts, and statistical deviations in emission patterns.
