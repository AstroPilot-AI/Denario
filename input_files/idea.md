	* Disentangling the Impact of Feedback and Cosmology on Black Hole–Galaxy Scaling Relations: Insights from the CAMELS Simulation Suite
		- This study systematically quantifies how the slopes and scatter of the M_BH–M_star and M_BH–sigma_v relations depend on feedback and cosmological parameters.
		- Leverages the unprecedented parameter coverage and statistical power of the CAMELS dataset.
		- Provides new constraints on the co-evolution of galaxies and their central black holes.
