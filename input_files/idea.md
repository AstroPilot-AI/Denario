Project Idea:
	* Hierarchical Inference of Cosmological and Feedback Parameters from Multi-scale Galaxy Statistics in 1,000 Simulated Catalogs
		- We present a hierarchical statistical framework that leverages both galaxy- and catalog-level summary statistics from 1,000 simulated galaxy catalogs to efficiently infer cosmological and feedback parameters.
		- The method identifies the most informative galaxy observables and illuminates parameter degeneracies, providing a blueprint for future simulation-based and observational inference studies.
