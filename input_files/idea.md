Project Idea:
	* Probing Primordial Non-Gaussianity through the Mass Distribution and Structural Properties of Galaxy Groups
		- Investigate the impact of primordial non-Gaussianity on the formation and evolution of large-scale structures by analyzing the mass distribution, structural properties, and clustering of galaxy groups in CAMELS simulations with fNL=200 and fNL=-200.
		- Filter the datasets to focus on the high-mass tail (>95th percentile) of Group_M_Mean200.
		- Fit the high-mass tail of the Group_M_Mean200 distribution using power-law or Schechter function models.
		- Use Anderson-Darling or Cram√©r-von Mises tests to compare the high-mass tails of datasets A and B.
		- Perform regression analysis with Group_R_Mean200 as the dependent variable and Group_M_Mean200 as the independent variable.
		- Compute the two-point correlation function of groups to assess differences in large-scale structure clustering between datasets.
		- Compare the results with theoretical predictions for halo mass functions and mass-concentration relationships under different fNL values.
		- Discuss the implications of the findings for our understanding of primordial non-Gaussianity and its role in cosmic structure formation.
