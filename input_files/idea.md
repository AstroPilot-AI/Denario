Project Idea:
	* Benchmarking Tensor Network Simulations of Quantum Algorithms in Disordered and Long-Range Interacting 1D Quantum Ising Models
		- This research systematically compares tensor network and classical simulation methods for quantum algorithms in 1D Ising models with disorder and long-range interactions.
		- Establishes quantitative guidelines for when tensor networks provide a computational advantage.
		- Reveals the practical limits of tensor networks in simulating complex quantum phases of matter.
